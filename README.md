esp8266 led lights for christmas using pixie lights and high-low voltage adapter and nodemcu arduino board

This was a quick hack to make some LED pixie lights into Christmas lights for a tall house plant.

This Arduino sketch outputs 2 lighting programs onto 4 different digital output pins.
The "program" allows various lighting profiles to be associated with any output line.

The output port is adjusted from 3v to 5v using digital level adjuster, which use 2N7000 mosfets which are capable of driving
low current "pixie light" LED strings.
